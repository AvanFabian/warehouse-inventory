# 📋 Complete Inventory System - End-to-End Testing Guide

**Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Feature:** Full Warehouse Inventory Management System  
**Architecture:** Multi-Warehouse with Pivot Table (Product ↔ Warehouse)  
**Status:** Ready for Comprehensive Testing

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### **Multi-Warehouse Model**
This system uses **industry-standard many-to-many relationship** between Products and Warehouses:

```
Product (ELC-001)
    ↓
product_warehouse (pivot table)
    ├─ Warehouse A → Stock: 15 units, Rack: A-01-01
    ├─ Warehouse B → Stock: 20 units, Rack: B-02-03
    └─ Warehouse C → Stock: 10 units, Rack: C-05-12
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ One product can exist in multiple warehouses
- ✅ Each warehouse tracks stock independently
- ✅ Stock movements are warehouse-specific
- ✅ Supports inter-warehouse transfers
- ✅ Prevents duplicate product codes

---

## ✅ Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Database Preparation
```bash
# Fresh database with ONLY users and warehouses (no master data)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# This will create:
# - 3 Users: admin@warehouse.test, manager@warehouse.test, staff@warehouse.test
# - 2 Warehouses: Main Warehouse (Jakarta), Secondary Warehouse (Surabaya)
# - NO categories, suppliers, or products (you'll create them manually)
```

### 2. Login Credentials
```
Email: admin@warehouse.test
Password: password
Role: Admin (full access)
```

### 3. What to Test
We'll test the **COMPLETE inventory workflow** in this order:
1. **Master Data Setup** (Categories, Suppliers, Products)
2. **Stock Management** (Stock In, Stock Out, Stock Opname)
3. **Inter-Warehouse Transfers**
4. **Sales Cycle** (Customers, Sales Orders, Invoices)
5. **Reports & Dashboard**

---

## 📦 PHASE 1: Master Data Setup

### **STEP 1.1: Create Categories** 🏷️

**Path:** Dashboard → Master Data → Kategori → + Tambah Kategori

**Test Data (Create 3 categories):**
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Multi-Warehouse Behavior**
- You'll select **ONE warehouse** when creating product
- Product will be assigned to that warehouse with initial stock = 0
- Later, you can add the same product to OTHER warehouses via Stock In
- Product code must be UNIQUE across ALL warehouses

**Test Data (Create 5 products):**

```

- [ ] ✅ Edit product info (name, price, min_stock)
- [ ] ✅ Search products by code/name
- [ ] ✅ Filter by category
- [ ] ✅ Filter by warehouse
- [ ] ✅ Filter by status (active/inactive)

**⚠️ Critical Test: Prevent Duplicate Codes**

- ELC-001 in Secondary WH: 15 units

Test:
1. Create Stock Opname for Main Warehouse
2. Select ELC-001
3. System Qty shows: 20 (from Main WH, not total)
4. Enter Actual Qty: 18
5. Save
6. Verify:
   ✅ ELC-001 in Main WH: 18 units (adjusted)
   ✅ ELC-001 in Secondary WH: 15 units (unchanged)
   ✅ Total: 33 units (18 + 15)
```
